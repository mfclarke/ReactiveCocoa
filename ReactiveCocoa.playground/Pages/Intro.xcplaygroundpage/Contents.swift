 ## Signals, Events, Values
 Say you want to send an ```Int``` somewhere. In ReactiveCocoa 4 speak, that ```Int``` is a value, that is sent along a ```Signal```. A ```Signal``` can be used to send any number of values, so it's best to think about it as a continuous stream that values flow down.
 
 To manually send a value down a ```Signal```, you need to use the ```Signal```'s ```Observer``` object. The naming of the ```Observer``` object is a little confusing, since it can really only be used to send stuff down a ```Signal```, but that's what the Reactive Cocoa guys chose. Anyway, a ```Signal``` and it's corresponding ```Observer``` are created at the same time with the ```pipe``` func.
 
 That's a bit to take in, so let's set up a ```Signal``` to demonstrate:
 */
do {
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = number
    }
    
    observer.sendNext(10)
    observer.sendNext(5)
    observer.sendNext(12)
}
/*:
 So what's going on here? First, we use ```pipe``` to get our ```Signal``` ```Observer``` pair. Our ```Signal``` has been set up to have ```Int```s flow along it. We then set up a closure on the ```Signal``` to fire every time a value is sent. Finally, we send some ```Int```s down the ```Signal```.
 
 As you can see from the graph, the ```observeNext``` closure has fired once for each ```Int``` sent, in the order that we sent them ðŸŽ‰
 
 But what's with the *Next* stuff? Well, values are actually sent down a ```Signal``` wrapped in *Next* ```Event```s. There are a few different types of ```Event```s that can be sent down a ```Signal``` - more on this shortly.
 
 So the cool thing about ```Signal```s is that they can be observed by any number of closures (and in turn, any number of objects). So one the value of one```sendNext``` can be received and used in many different ways and contexts.
 */
do {
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = number
    }
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = 1.0 / Float(number)
    }
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = "The number is \(number)"
    }
    
    observer.sendNext(10)
    observer.sendNext(5)
    observer.sendNext(12)
}
/*:
 ### Event Types
 As mentioned before, values sent down a ```Signal``` are actually wrapped in a *Next* ```Event```. There are other ```Event``` types too.
 
 First, there's the *Failed* ```Event```. The *Failed* ```Event``` carries an ```ErrorType``` and when sent causes the stream to stop. So if we encounter a situation where we want the ```Signal``` to stop, and to inform anything observing the ```Signal``` what went wrong, we can simply ```sendFailed``` with an ```ErrorType```
 */
do {
    enum IntError: ErrorType {
        case SomeErrorHappened
    }
    
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, IntError>.pipe()
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = number
    }
    
    signal.observeFailed { error in
        let e = error
    }
    
    observer.sendNext(10)
    observer.sendNext(5)
    observer.sendFailed(.SomeErrorHappened)
    observer.sendNext(12)
}
/*:
 The last value (12) didn't send, because the ```Signal``` had already failed with the *Failed* ```Event``` carrying the ```SomeErrorHappened``` Error. Perfect.
 
 We also have a *Completed* ```Event```. This also causes the ```Signal``` to stop, but without sending an *Error* ```Event```. We use this to indicate the ```Signal``` is finished and we don't need it anymore. Even if we're clumsy with our code and try to send a *Next* ```Event``` after a ```Signal``` has completed, it won't send - the ```Signal``` is already stopped.
 */
do {
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()
    signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = number
    }
    
    observer.sendNext(10)
    observer.sendNext(5)
    observer.sendCompleted()
    observer.sendNext(12)
}
/*:
 And finally there is the *Interrupted* ```Event```, which is very similar to the *Completed* ```Event```, but happens automatically. So you know how you call the ```observe``` methods on the ```Signal``` to add closures that fire when different ```Event```s flow down the ```Signal```? We can stop observing by using the ```Disposable``` object returned. When we call ```dispose``` on this object, the observation stops. And when all the ```Disposable```s have been ```disposed```, the ```Signal``` stops with the *Interrupted* ```Event```, since there's no use in a ```Signal``` if nothing is observing the ```Event```s.
 */
do {
    let (signal, observer) = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()
    let disposable = signal.observeNext { number in
        let x = number
    }
    
    observer.sendNext(10)
    observer.sendNext(5)
    disposable?.dispose()
    observer.sendNext(12)
}
/*:
 ### Real World Signal Usage
 This whole time we've used the ```pipe``` function, but most of the time we'll be getting ```Signal```s back from the ```rac_``` extensions we get for free from ReactiveCocoa, and interacting with those. However, sometimes we might need to bridge between the two worlds of ReactiveCocoa and the rest of your codebase. This is what ```pipe``` is really for. Here's an example of the kind of bridging we're talking about.
 */

    static func animate(duration: NSTimeInterval, animations: () -> ()) -> Signal<Void, NoError> {
        let (signal, observer) = Signal<Void, NoError>.pipe()
        animateWithDuration(duration, animations: animations) { completed in
            observer.sendNext()
        }
        return signal
    }

 Can you guess what it does? ðŸ˜œ
 
 So now we can use this in our chains. How about a multi step animation without a pyramid of doom? And let's use the built in UIButton rac func to fire it all off.

/*:
 Ignoring the ugly translation of the Reactive Cococa 2 ```RACSignal``` to Reactive Cocoa 4's ```SignalProducer``` with the correct ```NoError``` type, it looks very straight forward. In fact, if you think of each ```.flatMap(.Latest)``` as the word "then", it reads almost like how you would describe the animation verbally: "It animates the first view to -200 x while fading it out, then it animates the second view to 200 x while fading it out etc."
 
 Funnily enough, for these kinds of things, we could use the ReactiveCocoa ```then``` operator, which waits until the *Completed* ```Event``` has been sent from the previous ```SignalProducer```s ```Signal```. Unfortunately, ```then``` doesn't pass any ```Value```s in, but for stuff like this that doesn't matter. And of course, it's just a simple convenience extension away from having this semantic, if you so choose.
 
 This kind of stuff is a bit like promises, which are discussed in detail on the [Next Page](@next).
 
 For other Signal manipulations, including aggregation, merging, zipping and combining, see the ReactiveCocoa documentation on [Basic Operators](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/Documentation/BasicOperators.md).
